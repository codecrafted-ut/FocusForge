# FocusForge

**FocusForge** is a simple student productivity web app built as a single HTML file.  

It was one of my early projects where I experimented with:
- Task focus  
- Minimal UI  
- Distraction-free layouts  

This project represents my first attempts at building tools for students to manage their focus effectively.

## Focus Series
FocusForge is the first project in my **Focus Series** — a set of productivity tools built for students.

The next project in this series is **FocusGuard**, a desktop app focused on deep work, context awareness, and discipline.
